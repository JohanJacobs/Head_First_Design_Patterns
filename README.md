## Chapter 1 - Strategy Pattern

  

>**Strategy Pattern** : The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

  

## Chapter 2 - Observer Pattern

  

>**Observer Patter**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Chapter 3 - Decorator Pattern

  

>**Decorator Patter**:Attach Additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

>**Things to Note**: 
>- Can add a lot of small classes.
>- Type Specific when working with decorators.
>- Can increase complexity of code.
>- Have to instantiate and wrap each component.
  
  

## OO Principles

  

-  **Encapsulate what varies.**

-  **Favor composition over inheritance.**

-  **Program to interfaces, not implementations**.

-  **Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.**

-  **Open Close Principle: Open to Extending,Closed for modification.**

  

## OO Basics

-  **Abstraction**

-  **Encapsulation**

-  **Polymorphism**

-  **Inheritance**
