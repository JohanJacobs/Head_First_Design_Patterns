# Head First Design Patterns

>The O'Reilly Head First - Design Patterns examples for C++



## Chapter 1 - Strategy Pattern

>**Strategy Pattern** : The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Chapter 2 - Observer Pattern

>**Observer Patter**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
  

## OO Principles

- **Encapsulate what varies.**
- **Favor composition over inheritance.**
- **Program to interfaces, not implementations**.
- **Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.**

## OO Basics
- **Abstraction**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Inheritance**
